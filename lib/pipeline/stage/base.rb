module Pipeline
  module Stage # :nodoc:
    # A stage represents one of the steps in a pipeline. Stages can be reused by
    # different pipelines. The behaviour of a stage is determined by subclasses of
    # Pipeline::Stage::Base implementing the method #run:
    #
    #   class PrepareIngredients < Pipeline::Stage::Base
    #     def run
    #       Ingredients.each do |ingredient|
    #         ingredient.wash
    #         ingredient.slice!
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If a stage need access to its associated pipeline, it can call the association
    # <tt>pipeline</tt>.
    #
    # == Stage Name
    #
    # By default, a stage will have a standard name that corresponds to its fully
    # qualified class name (e.g. Pipeline::Stage::Base or SamplePipeline::SampleStage).
    # You can provide a more descriptive name by calling <tt>default_name</tt>:
    #
    #   class PrepareIngredients < Pipeline::Stage::Base
    #     self.default_name = "Prepare Ingredients for Cooking"
    #   end
    #
    # You can retrieve the name of a stage using the <tt>name</tt> attribute:
    #
    #   stage = PrepareIngredients.new
    #   stage.name # => "Prepare Ingredients for Cooking"
    #
    # == Error Handling
    #
    # In case of failure, a stage can raise special exceptions (RecoverableError or
    # IrrecoverableError) to determine what happens to the pipeline. Please refer to
    # Pipeline::Base for a description of the possible outcomes. Any failure will
    # persist the Exception's message on the <tt>message</tt> attribute and will move
    # the stage to a :failed state.
    #
    # == State Transitions
    #
    # The following diagram represents the state transitions a stage instance can
    # go through during its life-cycle:
    #
    # :not_started ---> :in_progress ---> :completed
    #                       ^ |
    #                       | v
    #                     :failed
    #
    # [:not_started] The stage was instantiated but not started yet.
    # [:in_progress] After started or retried, the stage remains on this state while
    #                executing.
    # [:completed]   After successfully executing, the stage is completed.
    # [:failed]      If an error occurs, the stage goes into this stage.
    #
    # == Callbacks
    #
    # You can define custom callbacks to be called before (+before_stage+) and after
    # (+after_stage+) executing a stage. Example:
    #
    #   class PrepareIngredients < Pipeline::Stage::Base
    #     before_stage :wash_ingredients
    #
    #     def run
    #       puts "Slicing..."
    #     end
    #
    #     protected
    #     def wash_ingredients
    #       puts "Washing..."
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   class Cook < Pipeline::Stage::Base
    #     after_stage :serve
    #
    #     def run
    #       puts "Cooking..."
    #     end
    #
    #     protected
    #     def serve
    #       puts "bon appetit!"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   class MakeDinnerPipeline < Pipeline::Base
    #     define_stages PrepareIngredients >> Cook
    #   end
    #
    #   Pipeline.start(MakeDinnerPipeline.new)
    #
    # Outputs:
    #   Washing...
    #   Slicing...
    #   Cooking...
    #   bon appetit!
    #
    # Callbacks can be defined as a symbol that calls a private/protected method (like the
    # example above), as an inline block, or as a +Callback+ object, as a regular
    # +ActiveRecord+ callback.
